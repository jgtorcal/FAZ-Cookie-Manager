# FAZ Cookie Manager

**The only cookie consent plugin you need. 100% free, zero cloud dependencies, no subscriptions.**

---

**Tired of cookie consent plugins that lock essential features behind paywalls, require cloud accounts, or send your visitors' data to third-party servers?**

FAZ Cookie Manager is a WordPress plugin that gives you everything you need to make your site compliant with international privacy regulations -- completely free, with no strings attached.

No account to create. No cloud service to connect. No "premium" plan to unlock basic features like consent logging or geo-targeting. Everything runs on your own server, and you own all your data.

## Why FAZ Cookie Manager?

Most cookie consent plugins follow the same pattern: a free version with crippled features, and a paid tier starting at $10-50/month that unlocks what you actually need. FAZ Cookie Manager breaks that model:

| Feature | Others (free) | Others (paid) | FAZ Cookie Manager |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cookie banner | Limited | Full | **Full** |
| Cookie scanner | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Consent logging + CSV export | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Google Consent Mode v2 | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| IAB TCF v2.3 + GVL | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Geo-targeting | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Multi-language (180+) | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Cloud dependency | No | **Yes** | **No** |
| Price | Free | $10-50/mo | **Free forever** |

> **A note on IAB TCF v2.3:** The plugin includes a fully functional IAB TCF v2.3 CMP implementation -- TC String encoding, GVL integration, vendor consent UI, and all required `__tcfapi()` commands work correctly. However, for the TC String to be recognized by the ad-tech supply chain, the CMP must be registered with IAB Europe (which requires an annual fee). CMP registration is on the roadmap. If you'd like to help make it happen, consider supporting the project:

#### CMP ID and IAB Registration

FAZ Cookie Manager works in two modes:

| Mode | CMP ID | What works | What doesn't |
|------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Self-hosted** (default) | `0` | Banner, cookie blocking, Google Consent Mode v2, consent logging, all admin features | Ad-tech vendors ignore the TC String (unrecognized CMP) |
| **IAB-registered** | Your ID | Everything above **plus** full TCF vendor chain -- SSPs, DSPs, and ad exchanges read and honor the TC String | Requires [IAB CMP registration](https://iabeurope.eu/cmp-list/) (annual fee) |

**When do you need a registered CMP ID?**

- If you run programmatic advertising (header bidding, ad exchanges) and need the buy-side to respect granular vendor consent via the TC String
- If your DPA or legal counsel requires a registered CMP for TCF compliance

**When is self-hosted (CMP ID = 0) sufficient?**

- You only need GDPR/ePrivacy-compliant cookie consent (banner + script blocking)
- You use Google Consent Mode v2 (GCM uses its own consent signal channel, independent of TCF)
- You don't participate in the IAB programmatic advertising supply chain

To set your CMP ID: **Settings > IAB TCF v2.3 > CMP ID**

### Microsoft Consent Integration

- **UET Consent Mode**: Sets `ad_storage`/`analytics_storage` defaults to denied, updates on consent
- **Clarity Consent API**: Calls `window.clarity('consent')` when analytics accepted

### Consent Logging

Stores proof of consent in a local database table for GDPR accountability:

- **Consent ID**: Unique per-visitor identifier
- **Status**: accepted, rejected, or partial
- **Categories**: JSON map of which categories were accepted/rejected
- **IP hash**: SHA256 hash (privacy-preserving, no raw IPs stored)
- **Pagination** and **search** in admin UI
- **CSV export** with date-stamped filename
- **Retention period**: Configurable (default: 12 months)

### Pageview Analytics

Built-in analytics dashboard -- no Google Analytics needed for basic metrics:

- **Events tracked**: pageview, banner_view, banner_accept, banner_reject, banner_settings
- **Dashboard charts**: Daily pageview trend, accept/reject rates

### Geolocation

Detects visitor country for geo-targeted banner display:

- **Detection chain**: Cloudflare > Apache mod_geoip > PHP GeoIP extension > ip-api.com
- **Geo-targeting modes**: ALL (everyone), EU (EU/EEA + UK), US only, Custom country list
- **Proxy-aware**: Reads `CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP` headers
- **Cached**: 1-hour WordPress transient per IP

### Multilingual Support

- **10 bundled languages**: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese (PT + BR), Hungarian, Finnish
- **180+ selectable languages** in the admin configuration
- **Browser language detection**: Parses `Accept-Language` header with quality factor sorting
- **Plugin integration**: Polylang and WPML auto-detected
- **Per-language banner content**: Separate title, description, button text per language
- **RTL auto-detection**: Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Kurdish, Urdu
